# MBF2y UMAPINFO Extensions v0.2.3

MBF2y adds a few keys to the `UMAPINFO` standard. These keys should only be consumed when the wad is initialized in MBF2y or later complevels when using a port with complevel support (such as when using a `COMPLVL` lump or command line parameter).

Ports that do not utilize complevels/rely upon demo compatibility should always consume these keys if present.

**Please note that this area is still under very early discussion.**

| `allowcrouch`          | In ports that allow crouching, if set to `false`, jumping will be disabled in this map.                                                                                                                                                                                                | `true`                    |
| `allowfreelook`        | In ports that allow freelook, if set to `false`, freelook will be disabled in this map.                                                                                                                                                                                                | `true`                    |
| `allowfreeaim`         | In ports that allow freelook and also enable free aiming, if set to `false`, free aim will be disabled in this map, even if freelook is allowed.                                                                                                                                       | `true`                    |
| `resethealth`          | Upon entry into this map, the player's health will be restored to its initial value. This does not affect weapons, ammunition, or armor.                                                                                                                                               | `false`                   |
| `resetarmor`           | Upon entry into this map, the player's armor will be restored to its initial state. (Note that for most ports without the ability to define custom armor, i.e. player classes, this will be no armor, but gameplay mods that cause the player to spawn with armor should be observed.) | `false`                   |
| `resetinventory`       | Upon entry into this map, the player's weapons and ammunition will be restored to their initial states.                                                                                                                                                                                | `false`                   |
| `defaultcolormap`      | Applies a default colormap to all sectors in the map without the need for linedef specials. This is overridden by any linedef specials applying an explicit colormap as a middle sidedef.                                                                                              | null; no colormap applied |
| `defaultuppercolormap` | Applies a default colormap to all "deep ceiling" Boom sectors. This overrides `defaultcolormap` but is overridden by any linedef specials applying an explicit colormap as an upper sidedef.                                                                                           | null; no colormap applied |
| `defaultlowercolormap` | Applies a default color map to all "deep floor" Boom sectors. This overrides `defaultcolormap` but is overridden by any linedef specials applying an explicit colormap as a lower sidedef.                                                                                             | null; no colormap applied |
